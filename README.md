# Plan

- Framework - next js
- CSS - one global css file, split into modules if appropriate
- Hero section - Greeting, links to github and linked in, maybe 3d with tech icons orbiting like planets
- Intro section - Short explanation of who I am and the tools I use.
- Tools - maybe some sort of pie chart or line with a percentage chart where I show where I have spent most of my time.
- Projects section - picture with short explanation, tags for tech, links to code and live site
- contact form
